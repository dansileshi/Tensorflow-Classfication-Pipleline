# Tensorflow-Classfication-Pipleline

We will use the [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). This image dataset has 100 classes with 500 training images and 100 test images per class. 

The goal is to use the tf.data module preprocessing tools to construct a data preporcessing pipeline including filtering and function mapping over the dataset to classify the images.
